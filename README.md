# Deliveroo-Web-Scraper
This takes all the restaurant waiting times data from deliveroo.com from an area which is specified in the code. 
The idea behind this is that it shows trends of demand, so can be used by cycle-couriers to work out the best time to work.
execute with:

python deliverooWebScraper.py. 

It will run continuously until you stop it in command line. It writes results to a CSV file.
